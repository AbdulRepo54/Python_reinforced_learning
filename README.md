# Python_reinforced_learning

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Examples repository! This collection of Python scripts demonstrates the implementation of Q-learning algorithms across different Gym environments. Below you'll find detailed instructions on how to use the provided scripts for training and evaluation.
Contents

    FrozenLake-v1 Q-learning
    FrozenLake-enhanced Q-learning
    Taxi-v3 Q-learning
    CartPole-v1 Q-learning

Installation

To run these scripts, you'll need to have Python and the necessary packages installed. If you don't have them yet, you can install the required packages using pip:

bash

pip install gymnasium numpy matplotlib pickle-mixin

Usage
1. FrozenLake-v1 Q-learning

This script uses the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym to demonstrate basic Q-learning.

    Script: frozen_lake_q.py

    How to Run:

    bash

python frozen_lake_q.py

Parameters:

    episodes: Number of episodes to run.
    is_training: Boolean flag to indicate if the Q-table should be trained or loaded.
    render: Boolean flag to enable or disable rendering.

Example Usage:

python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(1000, is_training=False, render=True)

    This will load a pre-trained Q-table and render the environment.

2. FrozenLake-enhanced Q-learning

This script uses an enhanced version of the FrozenLake environment. You'll need to register the enhanced environment in Gym before running the script.

    Script: frozen_lake_enhanced_q.py

    How to Run:

    bash

python frozen_lake_enhanced_q.py

Parameters:

    episodes: Number of episodes to run.
    is_training: Boolean flag to indicate if the Q-table should be trained or loaded.
    render: Boolean flag to enable or disable rendering.

Example Usage:

python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(15000, is_training=True, render=True)

    This will train a Q-table for 15,000 episodes and render the enhanced FrozenLake environment.

3. Taxi-v3 Q-learning

This script demonstrates Q-learning on the Taxi-v3 environment.

    Script: taxi_q.py

    How to Run:

    bash

python taxi_q.py

Parameters:

    episodes: Number of episodes to run.
    is_training: Boolean flag to indicate if the Q-table should be trained or loaded.
    render: Boolean flag to enable or disable rendering.

Example Usage:

python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(15000, is_training=True, render=True)

    This will train a Q-table for 15,000 episodes and render the Taxi environment.

4. CartPole-v1 Q-learning

This script uses the CartPole-v1 environment to demonstrate Q-learning with discretized state spaces.

    Script: cartpole_q.py

    How to Run:

    bash

python cartpole_q.py

Parameters:

    is_training: Boolean flag to indicate if the Q-table should be trained or loaded.
    render: Boolean flag to enable or disable rendering.

Example Usage:

python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(is_training=True, render=True)

    This will train the Q-table and render the CartPole environment.
